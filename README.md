Raspi Sample Implementation of "Neurosurgeon: Collaborative Intelligence Between Cloud and Mobile Edge"

# Some resources
- A github repo that alos compression of np-arrays then sends over a socket:  <https://github.com/sabjorn/NumpySocket>
    - I'll probably add a submodule to this repo in the future, but I rather do other things. :)
- If the above github repo doesn't work, then check this out: https://pypi.org/project/mlsocket/)
