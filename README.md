Raspi Sample Implementation of "Neurosurgeon: Collaborative Intelligence Between Cloud and Mobile Edge"

## Dependencies

- I will get to this when I have the motivation.
  - torch, numpy, etc...

## Some resources

### Socket Stuff

- A github repo that alos compression of np-arrays then sends over a socket:  <https://github.com/sabjorn/NumpySocket>
  - I'll probably add a submodule to this repo in the future, but I rather do other things. :)
- If the above github repo doesn't work, then check this out: https://pypi.org/project/mlsocket/)

### Pytorch Stuff

- Here is a link to the tutorial that I followed to implement a fashion mnist classifier. <https://towardsdatascience.com/build-a-fashion-mnist-cnn-pytorch-style-efb297e22582>

### Final Integration

- Originally thought to use pytorch hook functionality to implement neurosurgeon. Here are some links to [forums](https://discuss.pytorch.org/t/stop-model-evaluation-with-forward-hook/12882) and blogs about it.

- There is also this [github from aazim1](https://github.com/aazim18/Python)
